#### Terrain Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements terrain classification using three different deep learning approaches: ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), SegNet, and AlexNet. The models are trained on two distinct datasets for terrain classification tasks.

Models
* ELM (Extreme Learning Machine)

Fast single-hidden layer feedforward network
Optimized for quick training speeds
Input weights randomly assigned and fixed
Only output weights trained using least squares

* SegNet

Deep encoder-decoder architecture for semantic segmentation
Each encoder layer has corresponding decoder layer
Preserves high-frequency details in segmentation
Maintains spatial information through max-pooling indices

* AlexNet

Pre-trained CNN architecture, modified for terrain classification
5 convolutional layers, 3 fully connected layers
Modified final layers for terrain classes
Saved weights provided in weights/ directory
